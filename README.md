# Aviation_Occurrence_AIClassifier
Investigations of aviation occurrences are governed by ICAO Annex 13 guidance, which defines Accident and Serious Incident classifications that requires necessary investigation by a State. While the Accident classification is fairly clear, the definition for Serious Incident is much more open to individual users' interpretation. This classifier code uses Machine Learning to help determine and classify an event into either an "Incident" (need not be investigated) or a "Serious Incident" (needs to be investigated), thus assisting aviation safety investigators in focusing on their safety duties while fulfilling ICAO Annex 13 obligations.
