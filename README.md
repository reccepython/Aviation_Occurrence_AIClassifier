# Aviation_Occurrence_AIClassifier

# Background
Investigations of aviation occurrences are governed by ICAO Annex 13 guidance, which defines Accident and Serious Incident classifications that requires necessary investigation by a State. 
# Problem statement
While the ICAO Annex 13's Accident classification is unambiguous, the definition for Serious Incident is much more open to individual users' interpretation. This gives rise to situations when different users may classify the same occurrence differently, for instance if one classifies an occurrence as an Incident, there is no obligation for an investigation under ICAO Annex 13, while if another person classifies the same event as a Serious Incident, a mandatory investigation is needed. There is a need to standardise the Incident/Serious Incident classification.
# Objective
This classifier code uses Machine Learning to help determine and classify an event into either an "Incident" (need not be investigated) or a "Serious Incident" (needs to be investigated), thus assisting aviation safety investigators to streamline their safety investigations workflow to efficiently fulfil ICAO Annex 13 obligations.
